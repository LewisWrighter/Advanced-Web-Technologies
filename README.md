## 📖 **Overview**  
**FitMotive** is a web-based **fitness tracking application** designed to help users log workouts, visualise progress, and stay motivated. The app was inspired by **MyFitnessPal, FitBod, and Jefit**, with the goal of improving their shortcomings by providing a **free, no-nonsense fitness tracking tool**.  

### **Key Features Implemented**

- **User Authentication** – Secure login and registration with password hashing.  
- **Reusable Components** – Standardised UI elements for a consistent experience.  
- **Motivational Quotes** – Dynamic quotes to inspire users and encourage consistency.

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**  
- 🐍 **Flask** – Backend framework for handling app logic and database interactions.  
- 🎨 **HTML5 & CSS3** – Structured and styled the user interface.  
- ⚡ **JavaScript** – Added interactivity to the front end.  
- 🗄️ **SQLAlchemy** – Managed database relationships and queries.  
- 🔐 **Werkzeug** – Used for secure password hashing and authentication.

## 🔄 **Key Changes During Development**  
### ❌ **Removed Features**  
- **Progress Visualisation (Charts.js)** – Initially planned but deprioritised due to time constraints and stability concerns.  
- **Muscle Group Analytics** – Excluded due to database complexity and UI challenges.  
- **Goal Setting** – Was considered but required advanced backend logic that was out of scope for the project timeline.  

### ✅ **Newly Added Features**

## 🔍 **Reflection**  
Developing **FitMotive** was both a **challenging and rewarding experience**. Initially, **learning Python and Flask** was difficult, but over time, it became an enjoyable and valuable skill.  

The most **technically demanding** aspects of the project were:  
- **Implementing secure authentication** – Managing password hashing and session data.  
- **Creating database relationships** – Using **SQLAlchemy** to personalise user experiences.  

Despite some **time constraints and feature cuts**, I’m **proud** of the final result and excited to explore **Flask** further in future projects!
